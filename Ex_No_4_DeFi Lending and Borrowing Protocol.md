# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol
# Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

# Algorithm:

Step 1: Users deposit ETH into the smart contract to earn interest over time.

Step 2: Users can borrow ETH by providing enough collateral (at least 150% of the borrowed amount).

Step 3: The contract checks that collateral is sufficient before allowing the loan.

Step 4: Interest is calculated dynamically based on how much ETH is borrowed compared to total deposits.

Step 5: If a borrowerâ€™s collateral value drops below the safe level (liquidation threshold), they can be liquidated.

Step 6: Liquidators can repay a borrower's debt and claim their collateral to maintain system stability.
